# bootsrap-site-drag-and-drop
I have used the mobistar utility for free to make this cool looking website for free and using drag and drop like wordpress.
It's worth noting that this is just a demo website so I have not changed any text or content in it, but you can do that in the utility.
After you are happy with what your website looks you can just click on publish to download it locally. Then, you can add any additional scripts for backend or for rendering purposes.
You can, if you want, edit it's css and js if required.

You can download the modistar utility from here - https://mobirise.com/.




Also they have a paid pack which can get you access to all of their themes, but most people will have the free themes enough for them already.
